# Fitz
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is an Instagram-styled web application with a focus on fashion and style trends. Users will be able to create posts that feature their outfits, along with links to where each clothing product was purchased. Other features include the ability to follow accounts, like, and comment on posts. Competitions are held for users to win prizes! This web application aims to connect fashion enthusiasts in order to discover new styles.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of this project will undergo two different phases. The first phase will consist of account creation with some of its relevant functions such logging in and creating posts. This portion will mainly be constructed by Wesley. Katarina will be responsible for developing a voting operation that includes a form of reward system. The second phase is what will bring the application together. Wesley will further incorporate the use of authorization to allow users to edit their posts and contests, including interactions between them such as a comment section. Katarina will finish off the contest segment by allowing users to enter their posts, display these in a tournament style during the voting process.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more detailed outline including specific components that will be implemented along with API logic can be found under the Fitz Final Project pdf. This file also includes a basic diagram explaining the intended features of our application and some references and inspiration.
